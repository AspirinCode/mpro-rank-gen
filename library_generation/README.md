# Generation of screening library

A screening library for testing our models is generated by using SMARTS-based rules to break synthetically accessible bonds within all screened molecules, and then enumerate & recombine between all of the synthons to generate an exhaustive library of molecules to be screened _in silico_. The top-scoring molecules are then synthesised and assayed in real life, as described in the paper (placeholder link).

The [screening library itself](https://github.com/wjm41/mpro-rank-gen/blob/main/data/screening_lib.txt.gz)  is included in the `data` folder of the git repo.
